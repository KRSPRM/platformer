# platformer
Hi, I started this project to learn myself about gamedev a more advanced programming. I have been following DaFluffys tutorial on Pygame Platformer game.
Hopefully I will understand more and in near future I will be able to create my own game. :D

Thanks to DaFluffyPotato <3 for his tutorial!!
